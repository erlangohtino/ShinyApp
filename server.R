#' Shiny user interface for the Central Limit App
#' Data Science Course 9 project
#' 
#' This is the server logic of a Shiny web application that
#' executes a number of runs of a random variable distribution simulation,
#' takes the means and pushes these averages in a histogram of means, which,
#' according to the Central Limit Theorem, should look like a gaussian.
#'
#' @param basePlot Histogram of the distributions being simulated.
#' @param distPlot Resulting means histogram
#' @param text1 Range of the histogram

#' @author Emilio Gonz√°lez
#' @details The distribution of the selected type is simulated the number of
#' runs specified, with the number of samples selected, and its average is
#' pushed into a vector which is later on plotted. The range of the resulting
#' distribution is output, to check that, the smaller the number of samples,
#' the higher the standard deviation. It also can be checked that the higher
#' the number of runs, the better a gaussian-like distribution is shaped.
#' The base distribution (using 500 samples) is also plotted, for information.
#' The theoretical mean of the distribution (red vertical line)
#' and the computed mean of the histogram (blue vertical line) are plotted as
#' well. In average, these two values are closer one another when the chosen
#' values are large.
