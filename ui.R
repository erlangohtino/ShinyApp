#' Shiny user interface for the Central Limit App
#' Data Science Course 9 project
#' 
#' This is the user-interface definition of a Shiny web application that
#' executes a number of runs of a random variable distribution simulation,
#' takes the means and pushes these averages in a histogram of means, which,
#' according to the Central Limit Theorem, should look like a gaussian.
#'
#' @param Samples The number of samples in each base distribution
#' @param Runs The number of samples in each base distribution
#' @param Distrib The kind of base distribution to simulate (exponential,
#'                uniform or log-normal)
#' @author Emilio Gonz√°lez
#' @details In the user interface, there is a sidebar with the parameters of
#' the simulation: two slide bars are presented to choose the
#' number of samples in the distribution for each simulation and the number of
#' simulations to be conducted. There is also a choice of the base distribution
#' (exponential, uniform or log-normal). The distributions have been chosen to
#' have a similar mean for plotting purposes. A sample distribution is also
#' displayed at the bottom of the sidebar to show what an individual element
#' would look like; its mean, an others alike, will be accrued in a subsequent
#' histogram, which is depicted in the main panel of the window. The theoretical
#' and computed means are displayed as well. The range of this histogram is also
#' shown at the bottom.
